In pcap file, we see that this is Stealth scan

SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reasons. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively typical and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections.

The port is also considered open if an SYN packet (without the ACK flag) is received in response.

This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning because you donâ€™t open a full TCP connection. You send an SYN packet as if you are going to open a real connection and then wait for a response. An SYN, ACK indicates the port is listening (open)
